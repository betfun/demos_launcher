# Introduction

As a solution engineer at Salesforce I have to build and run demos all the time. 

One of the question I often asked myself was about finding the best wasy to organise my work and I finally came out with this project. 

For more information please check: 

This project is based on the awesome work done in [angular-electron](https://github.com/maximegris/angular-electron)

Plase feel free to contribute with a pull request or by raising any issue you may find.


## To build for development

- **in a terminal window** -> npm start

Voila! You can use your Angular + Electron app in a local development environment with hot reload !

The application code is managed by `main.ts`. In this sample, the app runs with a simple Angular App (http://localhost:4200) and an Electron window.
The Angular component contains an example of Electron and NodeJS native lib import.
You can disable "Developer Tools" by commenting `win.webContents.openDevTools();` in `main.ts`.
